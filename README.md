# Soft Computing Assignment: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and NSGA-II
This repository contains implementations of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for solving optimization problems. These algorithms were developed as part of a Soft Computing assignment.

## Genetic Algorithm (GA)
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search and optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It is used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.
### Features
• Chromosome representation using real-valued vectors. </br>
• Tournament selection for parent selection. </br>
• Arithmetic crossover and uniform mutation operators. </br>
• Minimization problem optimization. </br>

## Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)
NSGA-II is a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm. It is used to optimize problems with multiple conflicting objectives.
### Features
• Chromosome representation using real-valued vectors. </br>
• Tournament selection for parent selection. </br>
• Simulated binary crossover (SBX) and polynomial mutation operators.</br>
• Multi-objective optimization using non-dominated sorting.</br>

## Usage
To run the Genetic Algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile and execute the cpp program.
